    Activate a user account.

    This function is used to activate a user account through an email confirmation process.
    It takes a request, a base64 encoded user ID (uidb64), and a token as parameters.

    Parameters:
    - request: The HTTP request object.
    - uidb64: A base64 encoded string representing the user's ID. This is typically sent to the user's email.
    - token: A token generated for the user to verify their email. This is also sent to the user's email.

    The function decodes the uidb64 to get the user's ID and attempts to fetch the corresponding user from the database.
    If the user exists and the token is valid, the user's 'is_active' field is set to True, effectively activating the account.

    Returns:
    - An HttpResponse indicating whether the activation was successful or not. If successful, it notifies the user that
      they can now log in. If not, it informs them that the activation link is invalid.
